# PareshPatnaik_AirportBaggageSystem

This project is about an 'Airport Baggage System' , where the objective is to find an optimal path to route bags to destination.
The problem statement uses Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the Shortest distance from a soure node to all other nodes in the graph.

It accepts commandline input in a specific sequence and as output displays on console the optimal route aken to reach the destination and the time taken to do so.
